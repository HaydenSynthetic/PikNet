# TotalMiner-Network
Total Miner Multiplayer Network 

# Info
This server application is intended to be used with [TMFMP Mod by XBLToothPik](https://github.com/XBLToothPik/TotalMiner-Network---Mod)

# What's different?
The original fork of this application has ended development, although I have full access as an editor of the original repo, I chose to fork it for consistency, and so people have a choice between my edits and the original.

Planned additions will be added below

# TODO
* End session if the host backs out of lobby screen (both mod and server code)
* Discord webhook integration to display network status

# Security To Be Addressed
* Handshakes
* Gamer kicks (need to be handled by server or host directly)
